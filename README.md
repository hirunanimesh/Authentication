Project Description

This is a simple full-stack web application developed to explore and implement role-based user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The application securely stores user tokens in HTTP-only cookies, and user information is managed using Redux on the client side.

A key focus of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Docker. The entire application — both frontend and backend — has been fully containerized using Docker, enabling consistent development and deployment environments.

Key Features:

Role-based user authentication (e.g., student, teacher)

Secure JWT token handling with cookie storage

State management using Redux

Full Dockerization (Dockerfile and Docker Compose)

Backend API integration

This project served as a learning platform for building secure, scalable applications with modern web technologies and containerization.
